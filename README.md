# Twitter-Scraping

Twitter Scraping and Deploying a Streamlit Web Application:
By using the “snscrape” library, scrape the Twitter data from Twitter Reference and create a dataframe with date, id, url, tweet content, user,reply count, retweet count,language, source, and like count.
Store each collection of data into a document in MongoDB along with the hashtag or key word we use to scrape from Twitter. 
Create a GUI using Streamlit. After scraping, the data needs to be displayed in the page and need a button to upload the data into Database and download the data into csv and json format.
